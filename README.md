# Upper Hand

Extract who holds the power, and find out who has the upper hand in your relations, from your emails ([read more](http://io9.com/to-see-who-holds-the-power-in-your-relationships-check-1630619630)). Currently it only supports Gmail.

## Discliamer

This is just a very limited and nonsense experiment. Do not take it seriously. Nobody has the upper hand in a relationship. Friends do not want to take advantage of their friends. A friend in need, is a friend indeed!

## ToDo

- [ ] Semantic role labeling to extract subject (A0 argument).
- [ ] Restrucure codes in another file rather than init.
